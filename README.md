## Hi there, I'm Nanda ðŸ‘‹
I started my career as a Ruby on Rails developer since 2 years ago. I do a cool stuff every day in my life. I focus on Backend, but sometimes I also learing any Frontend stuff. **BUT**, Backend is still the most part what makes me comfortable working as a Software Developer.

### tl;dr My life in a nut shell...
- ðŸ’» Currently working on Ruby on Rails Project (in a small developer team in Bali)
- ðŸš€ Currently learning Javascript, Hotwire-Rails, Software Testing, Docker, Ansible and Capistrano to make easier to deploy Rails app
