## Hi there, I'm Nanda ðŸ‘‹
I started my career as a Software Engineer and use Ruby on Rails as my main tech to build a web app. I do a cool stuff every day in my life. I focus on Backend, but sometimes I also learing any Frontend stuff. **BUT**, Backend is still the most part what makes me comfortable working as a Software Developer.

### tl;dr My life in a nut shell...
- ðŸ’» Currently working at [Mekari](https://mekari.com) as a Software Engineer
- ðŸš€ Currently learning how to ship application with good quality over quantity and curious with infrastructure stuff
